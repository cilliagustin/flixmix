### JSX Validation
The JSX conde was validated using [Eslint](https://eslint.org/). During my first run I encountered 2 errors that do not affect the functionality:
- missing in props in validation.
- and Do not pass children as props. Instead, nest children between the opening and closing tags (In my infiniteScroll components)

Due to this not really affecting the functionalities of the website were ignored and the Eslint setting where ovvertten to ignore this issues.

## Lighthouse Audit
All the pages that do not rquire validation were validated using LIghthouse Audit. This is because thoise that require validation on lighthouse audit are not able to be accessed and analized.
The performance scroce was lowered because of the size of the images. But that is due that the user can enter a image for a movie and in some pages they are displayed in a small format and the Lighthouse audit does not find this as good practices.
